# UK-microbiome-workshop-2024
Repo to contain all relevant information for the microbiome workshop

# **About**

The Microbiome Kickstart Workshop is designed to address the challenges faced by researchers in animal healh sciences, particularly with the increasing use of 16S rRNA gene sequencing in microbiome studies. As the field grows due to lower sequencing costs and improved bioinformatics tools, the intersection of molecular biology, microbiology, microbial ecology, and computer science with animal science and veterinary medicine can become daunting. This workshop aims to simplify these complexities, offering graduate students practical skills and confidence to engage in interdisciplinary microbiome research. By bridging the gap between traditional animal science studies and the technical demands of microbiome research, the workshop prepares participants for future challenges and innovations in animal health and disease.
